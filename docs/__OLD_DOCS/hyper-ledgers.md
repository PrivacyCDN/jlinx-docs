# Hyper Ledgers

Layer 1 

peer-to-peer nodes share single-author ledgers

nodes can be paid for by invested applications or hosted and charge for usage. this 
is how we pay for the network overhead instead of consensus.

this allows a base layer for peer-to-peer applications

## Single Author Ledgers




## Communication

bi-directional ledgers === real-time message passing **need to prove this**









------ move to docs on layer 2 ------- 
## Composit Views

a projection of mutltiple micro-ledgers are used to build multi-author data structures


---->  we need new forms of groups concensus <-----

Can we build multi-write databases using multiple streams?
