# JLINX Hosts

Pocesses that participants in the JLINX network are called **hosts**. Hosts are always-on servers that exchange Micro-Ledgers over a Kademlia based DHT.

We call them `hosts` and not `nodes` because hosts own the micro-ledgers they host. This is because a private key is required to update a micro ledger and private keys should never moved.

## Implementations

### Javascript
